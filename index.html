                            The impact of terroir can be noticed when comparing the same beans grown under different conditions. In addition to the Maranon Fortunato and the Ecuadorian Nacional example above, similar comparisons can be made elsewhere. At the Hacienda San Jose located
                            on the Paria Peninsula of northeast Venezuela you can find Chuao, another legendary cacao. Chuao is not a bean type but a name that delineates its' origin. Chuao village is located on the north central coast of Venezuela over
                            300 miles west of the Paria Peninsula. And like many plantations, Chuao consists of a mixture of genetically different bean types. Chuao is still known for producing a distinct flavor profile often described with intense acidity
                            and fruitiness. The Chuao grown at the Hacienda San Jose was taken from the original Chuao village. Although it carries the same name and genetic makeup, harvesting it in a very different environment changes it's flavor profile.
                            This is not an uncommon practice and can potentially add to the value and characteristics of the chocolate it is manufactured in to when skillfully done. The flavor from Chuao village is believed to correlate to the high humidity
                            and heavy rains that wash rich and fertile silt down the mountainsides to create unique soil conditions in the Chuao plantation. This is an example of the terroir, considered as the soil, weather conditions and farming practices
                            of a specific region. Soil and weather both being factors effecting flavor that the chocolate maker and farmer have little to no control over. There is a wide range of soil types within a single country alone and certainly
                            across the globe in countries that cacao can grow there is even a greater variety. Although there is suitable range that is needed, soils will vary by PH level, content of nutrient and organic matter as well as it's ability
                            to either retain moisture in dry climates or allow for drainage in regions with lots of rain. Furthermore, weather and climate changes are believed to have an effect on cacao growth too. Most notably effecting cacao growth
                            is the amount of rain and sun. Seasonal changes in weather are one reason some makers include harvest dates on the package too. In turn the climate differences can influence the farming practices. For example, cacao grown in
                            Java is often fire dried because the amount of rain often doesn't allow for proper sun drying that is possible in countries like Ghana. As a result chocolate made with cacao from Java often tastes smokey, a characteristic that
                            can be attributed to terroir.

                    As there is no standard in labeling chocolate there is also no standard in grading cocoa beans. Each country has their own governing authority. In Brazil it's the National Foreign Trade Council; in Ecuador it's the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, etc;
                    Dominican Republic has the Cocoa Department, Ministry of Agriculture; and so on. Most authorities grade based on percentage of faults in each of these categories: mould, slate, infestation, germination, shape, color, moisture and foreign
                    matter. Each authority uses their own set of descriptors and standards for each and the percentage of allowable faults varies greatly. See the table below for only a few examples. The point being, labeling a package with bean quality
                    would be almost pointless considering the serious lack of uniformity. However, as a consumer, ideally I would want to know if I'm paying for the highest quality or mid-grade before I spend my hard earned money. Wouldn't you?</p>

                            The craft chocolate movement is on the rise worldwide but it is no more evident anywhere than it is here in the United States. In 2006, there were fewer than 8 American craft chocolate makers and by early 2016 there were more than 160 passionate entrepreneurs
                            living their dream of making chocolate. No other country can offer as much variety. With this explosion you'll experience a wide range of creative expression in the American craft chocolate scene. Below we have highlighted
                            a few of these American makers to show how they are different and examples of what makes craft chocolate so interesting. At Fresco (Lynden, Washington), chocolate maker Rob Anderson, has championed his philosophy of making
                            chocolate tasting not only pleasing to taste but educational. Fresco sells chocolate bars from the same harvest of beans, made with the same mixture of ingredients, but then makes distinct batches by altering the roasting and
                            conching process and then displays the process on Fresco's packaging. Each batch results in very different taste experiences. In this way, he is able to display how the creativity and skill of the chocolate maker impacts the
                            end product. Originality is also evident by the type of equipment a chocolate maker uses. Early pioneers of the American craft chocolate movement were Art Pollard and Clark Goble (Amano Chocolate- Orem, Utah) who sought out
                            vintage chocolate making equipment from around the world that could help them produce the results they were aiming for. Earth stewards, Dan and Jael Rattigan in Asheville, North Carolina, created a rooftop solar production
                            deck for their company French Broad and have been experimenting roasting small batches with a parabolic trough solar roaster that Dan also built. Scott Moore of Tejas (Spring, Texas) is roasting cacao in the oven he built out
                            of reclaimed bricks. Barbara Wilson and Joe Meza of Mindo Chocolate Makers (Dexter, Michigan) use a hydraulic cocoa butter press so they can ensure the traceability and quality of their butter. Unique equipment choices in all
                            of these examples help to create distinctive profiles in the finished chocolate for each. At the time of this writing there were no fewer than 7 craft chocolate makers in the Hawaiin islands. Hawaii being the only state in
                            the U.S. where cacao is grown, gives these makers a better opportunity, if they choose, to control everything from growing, post harvest techniques and chocolate production. Other craft makers who don't have the luxury of growing
                            their own cacao still value being involved at the farm level. Environmentalist and forest-carbon specialist, Charles Kerchner (Kerchner Chocolate- Burlington, Vermont) works in the Dominican Republic on biodiversity and cacao
                            projects focused on planting fine flavored varietals, select grafted varietals and improving agricultural practices. These examples of innovations in craft chocolate emphasize it's desirability. While we only highlighted a
                            few American companies here there are many more companies to explore. Craft chocolate making is happening all over the world, from Europe, South America, Vietnam, Australia and beyond.

                    Like most artisan products, the price of craft chocolate is significantly higher than mass market or grocery store brands. Whereas 3oz of mass market chocolate would cost less than two dollars at your local grocer, the price for the same amount of craft
                    chocolate would probably start at 6 dollars and often as much as 10 -12 dollars. Although the initial price tag might be shocking there are very justifiable reasons for the high cost. Both ingredients and labor costs drive up the price
                    of the chocolate for a small company. Using high quality ingredients. Mass producers usually rely on less expensive bulk cacao and smaller craft makers tend to focus more on fine flavor and limited edition cacao. Fine flavor cacao
                    beans command a much higher price, often twice as much as a bulk bean. For several reasons, but a few are because these beans are less disease resistant, less hardy in variable climates and overall produce fewer beans per tree than
                    a high yielding bulk bean used by mass market companies. Fine flavor cacao also offers a larger range in flavor potential. Craft makers also pay more to farmers using the best post harvesting practices. Mass market chocolate companies
                    can sell at lower prices too because they purchase ingredients by the ton and use a variety of artificial ingredients that are used to cut costs and substitute for more expensive natural ingredients. See these two ingredient lists
                    taken directly from two packages labeled as “dark” chocolate.
