## Milestone 1 (Friday 8th April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

### 1. Dataset

*Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.*


### 2. Problematic

*Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop. What am I trying to show with my visualization? Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.*


### 3. Exploratory Analysis

Please check out [Jupyter Notebook](./Milestone%201%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb) for analysis.
