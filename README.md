## Milestone 1 (Friday 8th April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

### 1. Dataset

*Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.*

We decided to evaluate mainly three publicly available datasets that were found on Kaggle. All of the datasets contain 1000-2000 ratings of chocolate bars alongside some matedata on the latter.
The first, and most promising, one was created by Manhattan Chocolate Society, Flavors of Cacao [Internet]. Available from: [here](http://flavorsofcacao.com/). The dataset was last updated three months ago and code for crawling the most up-to-date information from the website was published alongside the data ([script](https://www.kaggle.com/code/andrewmvd/chocolate-ratings-crawler)). As most datasets, the available data is USA/Canada centric, with specific information only about companies in the two countries (but ratings of companies from around the world). The website [http://flavorsofcacao.com/](http://flavorsofcacao.com/) appears very trustworthy and thorough. It contains the data that is available on the dataset plus lots of informative studies and surveys on chocolate that were conducted by the Manhattan Chocolate Society and might be nice to include to our website as well. 
The second and third datasets are less up to date and contain fewer metadata fields. These were all retrieved from the same website, only 5 and 2 years before. For this reason, we decide to focus on the first.

The dataset is very clean: the missing fields are very few, and the only preprocessing required will be a merging of the two datasets and some processing on columns that contain list information (i.e. list of ingredients written as 'ingredient1, ingredient2').

### 2. Problematic

*Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop. What am I trying to show with my visualization? Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.*

We will shed light on the elements that contribute to creating the perfect chocolate bar, be it the bean, the company, the flavour and so on.

Switzerland is renowned for its chocolate production. The quality, the variety and the taste have given it the reputable position that it currently possesses. However, many of us have been eating chocolate without really knowing where it came from and the process involved in its production. We aim to provide users who are passionate about chocolate the opportunity to find out more about their favorite chocolate bars in a visually interactive way. In our project, we will allow users to find out the origins of any chocolate manufacturer as well as the type of beans and their country of origin for a given chocolate bar. Finally, we will allow users to input their own recipes for a chocolate of their imagination and provide them with feedback based on aggregates from ratings given by others according to the company origin, flavors, bean origin, how dark the bean is and how it's liked by people across the globe. 



### 3. Exploratory Analysis

Please refer to our [Jupyter Notebook](./Milestone%201%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb) for the analysis. 

### 4. Related Work

Most [related work on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=chocolate+bar+ratings+in%3Anotebooks+tags%3A%22data+visualization%22) is mostly limited to exploratory data analysis, with some notable projects trying to predict a chocolate bar's rating based on e.g. its cocoa percentage or ingredients. Some interesting graphs on relationships between cocoa bean origins and processing countries were found [in this notebook on Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tibhar940/chocolate-bar-ratings-python-eda-dataviz). We are not aware of any other project using this dataset for informative purposes, especially not ones with an interactive visualization.

We were particularly inspired by the beatufiful look and informative nature of the [Wine Journey](https://com-480-data-visualization.github.io/com-480-project-onvagagner/website/) project from this same course. We also want to put a unique twist on the visual theme, perhaps using Charlie and the Chocolate factory as an inspiration.
